Speedometer written in Rust

This hobby project is displaying a speedometer that is written in Rust to acheive a more customized looks. 

This is run on a Raspberry Pi 4B that I am using in order to drive the display. The end goal is to have the display be driven by a ESP32-Wroom Dev board to take data from an external source. 

The code as it is will draw a circular speedometer that is subdivided and has a needle drawn to display the speed (includes a digital readout of the current speed and units)
